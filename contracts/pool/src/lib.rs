    // cases. We avoid pulling in the `proptest`/`quickcheck` crates as a new

    // enforces elsewhere: yield_bps is capped at 5_000 (see `set_yield` /
    // `propose_yield_change`), and duration is bounded at 10 years, matching
    // `test_compound_interest_long_period_no_overflow` above — this is the
    // longest duration already demonstrated not to overflow `fixed_point_pow`'s
    // unchecked squaring at the maximum yield rate.
